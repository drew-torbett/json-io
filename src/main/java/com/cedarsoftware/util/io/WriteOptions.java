/**
 * This class contains all the "feature" control (options) for controlling json-io's
 * output JSON. An instance of this class is passed to the JsonWriter.toJson() APIs
 * to set the desired capabilities.
 * <br/><br/>
 * You can make this class immutable and then store the class for re-use.
 * Call the ".build()" method and then no longer can any methods that change state be
 * called - it will throw a JsonIoException.
 * <br/><br/>
 * This class can be created from another WriteOptions instance, using the "copy constructor"
 * that takes a WriteOptions. All properties of the other WriteOptions will be copied to the
 * new instance, except for the 'built' property. That always starts off as false (mutable)
 * so that you can make changes to options.
